    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",

    "Summary:\n",
    "This challenge involved the construction of various data frames that compared the passing rates in math and reading in different schools.  The data consisted of many students from a total of 15 schools and what their math and reading scores are.  The size and budget of each school have been given as well, which could be used to see if there is a possible correlation between the passing rate depending on the size of the school or how much of the budget can be divided to give each student the proper support they need.  Using these pieces of data for each student, multiple data frames can be made comparing what kind of schools tend to do better, how much money is allocated to each student based on the total budget of the school, and if the size of the school has a real effect on the passing rate.  The conclusions made are the culmination of combining different pieces of data and seeing how the pass rate is affected by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion 1:\n",
    "Based on the type_summary_df, or the database that compares the averages and passing rates depending on what type of school the students attend, charter schools have higher passing rates and averages compared to those of district schools.  The overall averages for math and reading scores are greater for students who attend charter schools.  In addition, the percentages for passing math, reading, and both subjects together are greater in charter schools rather than in district schools.  There are 8 charter schools out of the 15 total schools used in the data, and even though this means more than half of the schools are charter schools, the scores far exceed those from district schools.  No argument can be made that the scores are higher in charter schools because there are more schools in the data since the data frames used information comparing the percentages and averages of each school individually.  When comparing the charter schools individually to the district schools, the averages and passing rates still are superior in charter schools.  Even when separating the highest-performing schools from the bottom-performing schools, based on the percent of the overall passing rate, the top 5 schools that performed well were all charter schools; the top 5 schools that performed the poorest were all district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion 2:\n",
    "The total budget of the schools and the amount allocated to each student does not play a significant role in the passing rates of the students.  A common thinking is that if a school has enough money to offer the students they should be able to pass with higher passing rates since they have the chance to use more resources.  The sizes of the schools determine how much money would be given to them.  Schools with more students received a vastly higher budget compared to schools with fewer students, but the amount of money per student was within close range of each other.  When examining how much money can be allocated per student, there is no drastic difference between budgets per capita between schools.  Every single school has a budget per capita that is in the range of $580 to $655, and even though this seems like a big difference, this range did not have a massive impact on helping the students do better.  If anything, the data has shown that if a school has a higher budget, the overall passing rate of that school is significantly lower than that of a school with a smaller budget.  If a school has more money, this does not mean that it plays a significant task in helping students succeed, quite the opposite.  Based on this data, district schools tend to receive more money than charter schools, and when comparing any single district school to a charter school, the charter school will have a higher overall passing rate.\n",
